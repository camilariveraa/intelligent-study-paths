# Learning Path Agent MVP - Build Summary

## What Was Created

I've built a **working minimal prototype** of the Learning Path Agent system using Raindrop MCP. This MVP demonstrates the complete workflow from learning goal to personalized video learning path.

## How to Run

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Build
raindrop build

# 2. Run locally
raindrop dev

# 3. Test (in another terminal)
node src/scripts/test-api.js
```

See `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed instructions.

## What It Does

### 1. Session Creation
- User submits a learning goal (e.g., "I want to learn Vercel")
- System creates a new session in SmartMemory
- AI generates 3 contextual assessment questions

### 2. Knowledge Assessment
- User answers 3 questions about their current knowledge
- AI evaluates each answer to determine knowledge level:
  - none / basic / intermediate / advanced
- System builds a knowledge profile

### 3. Path Generation
- Identifies knowledge gaps (e.g., needs deployment basics, Git)
- Creates ordered topic tree (prerequisites first)
- Generates explanations for each topic's placement
- Selects 2-3 relevant videos per topic from mock dataset

### 4. Learning Path Delivery
- Returns complete structured learning path
- Modules ordered logically with prerequisites
- Each module includes explanation and videos
- Videos include title, channel, duration, and URL

## Example Output

For goal "I want to learn Vercel deployment":

```
📚 LEARNING PATH:
   Knowledge Level: intermediate
   Total Modules: 3
   Total Videos: 7

Module 1: deployment-basics
  → Understanding core deployment concepts before platform-specific features
  Videos:
    • Web Deployment Fundamentals (15:30)
    • Understanding Build vs Runtime (12:45)

Module 2: vercel-basics
  → Core Vercel platform features
  Videos:
    • Vercel Platform Overview (20:15)
    • Deploy Next.js to Vercel in 5 Minutes (8:30)

Module 3: git-basics
  → Version control fundamentals needed for deployment workflows
  Videos:
    • Git for Beginners (30:00)
    • Git Workflow Essentials (22:45)
```

## Key Technologies

- **Raindrop Framework** - Cloud application platform
- **Raindrop SmartMemory** - Multi-layered memory system for session state
- **Raindrop AI** - Large language model for assessment and generation
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Mock Data** - 50 curated video entries across 5 topic areas

## API Endpoints Implemented

✅ `POST /api/sessions` - Create new session
✅ `GET /api/sessions/:id` - Get session state
✅ `GET /api/sessions/:id/assessment/next` - Get next question
✅ `POST /api/sessions/:id/assessment/answer` - Submit answer
✅ `POST /api/sessions/:id/path/generate` - Generate learning path
✅ `GET /api/sessions/:id/path` - Get learning path
✅ `GET /health` - Health check

All endpoints include CORS headers for frontend integration.

## What's Working

✅ **Session Management** - Create and track sessions in SmartMemory
✅ **AI Question Generation** - Dynamic, contextual assessment questions
✅ **Answer Evaluation** - AI-powered knowledge level determination
✅ **Gap Analysis** - Automatic prerequisite identification
✅ **Path Generation** - Structured, ordered learning modules
✅ **Video Curation** - Topic-based video selection
✅ **Complete Flow** - End-to-end working prototype
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for AI failures
✅ **Testing** - Automated test script validates all endpoints

## What's Mocked (For MVP)

⚠️ **Video Dataset** - Using 50 hand-curated mock videos
   - Production would use YouTube API + SmartBucket semantic search

⚠️ **User Authentication** - No auth in MVP
   - Production would add user accounts

⚠️ **Persistent Storage** - Only working memory
   - Production would use SmartSQL for long-term storage

## Limitations

This MVP intentionally excludes:
- User authentication/authorization
- Video quality scoring (AI evaluation)
- Progress tracking (marking videos as watched)
- Episodic memory (learning from past sessions)
- Real YouTube API integration
- Advanced error handling
- Rate limiting
- Analytics/monitoring

These are covered in the full architecture documents.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Demo Ready)
1. ✅ MVP is ready to demo as-is
2. Run `node src/scripts/test-api.js` to verify
3. Share the QUICKSTART.md with team members

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Build React frontend for better UX
2. Add real YouTube videos to SmartBucket
3. Implement video quality evaluation
4. Add user authentication

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. Full production implementation (see IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
2. Deploy to production
3. Add progress tracking
4. Implement feedback system
5. Analytics dashboard

## Integration with Existing Frontend

You already have a Vite/React frontend in this project. To connect it:

```typescript
// Example API integration
const api = {
  createSession: async (goal: string) => {
    const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/sessions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ goal })
    });
    return res.json();
  },

  getNextQuestion: async (sessionId: string) => {
    const res = await fetch(
      `http://localhost:8080/api/sessions/${sessionId}/assessment/next`
    );
    return res.json();
  },

  // ... more methods
};
```

See `API_CONTRACTS.md` for complete API documentation.

## Architecture Highlights

### SmartMemory Usage
```typescript
// Session state stored in working memory
{
  sessionId: "session-123",
  goal: "Learn Vercel",
  phase: "assessment",
  questions: [...],
  answers: [...],
  knowledgeLevels: [...]
}
```

### AI Integration
- **Question Generation**: Uses AI with temperature 0.7 for creativity
- **Answer Evaluation**: Uses AI with temperature 0.3 for consistency
- **Path Generation**: Uses AI with temperature 0.6 for balanced output
- **Fallbacks**: All AI calls have fallback logic if model unavailable

### Mock Video Search
```typescript
// Simple keyword matching
searchVideosByTopic("vercel")
  → Returns all videos tagged with "vercel"

// In production: semantic search via SmartBucket
```

## Testing

### Automated Test
```bash
node src/scripts/test-api.js
```

Runs through complete flow:
1. Creates session
2. Answers 3 questions
3. Generates path
4. Displays results

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1
raindrop dev

# Terminal 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal": "I want to learn React"}'
```
